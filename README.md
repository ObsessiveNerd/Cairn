This is a digital character sheet for the Cairn TTRPG game (https://cairnrpg.com/).

There is nothing fancy about this. It has text boxes that need to manually updated, just a pencil and paper character sheet would. You can add a character picture as well. This is the furthest thing from polished, 
and was primarily meant as a tool for me. At some point I plan on going back to this and adding a bit of QoL improvements, but for now it is what it is.

It technically does have an auto save, but I wouldn't trust it. Sometimes the event doesn't trigger correctly on a text box, so it's still better to manually save a character before closing.
